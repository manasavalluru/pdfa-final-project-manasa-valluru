## Description
My final project is a word search puzzle generator. It has a few key components:
1. Allow users to select a difficulty level, ranging from easy to medium to hard
2. Allow users to select from 5 different themes, including "Types of Birds," "Tropical Fruits," "Famous Movies," "Famous Cities," and "Harry Potter"
3. Generate a successful word search utilizing the user's chosen theme and difficulty level
4. Save the word search to user's computer as a downloadable and printable PDF file

While I initially also wanted to include an option for users to play the word search digitally OR generate a PDF, I opted out of creating the digitally 
playable version as it proved to be too complex for my abilities and the time I felt I had to complete this project. In focusing on the PDF version, I was
able to expand into the other key components (themes, difficulty) with more time. The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out how to generate the word
search correctly and form it into a PDF file. I took some help for these aspects from this online tutorial: <https://medium.com/@sessioncodest/build-a-word-search-puzzle-game-in-python-1377a4dc2233>.

If I had more time, I would have liked to add a customization option for users to choose the colors and fonts on their PDF. I would have also liked to revisit
the original idea I had to create a digitally playable version. However, I am happy with the overall outcome of my project and had fun learning the concepts 
associated with each key element I wanted to include. I truly hope to use the knowledge I gained during this project, and all throughout this course, to further 
my programming skills and continue learning!
