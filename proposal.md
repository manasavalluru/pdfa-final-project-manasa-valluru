## Description
My project will be a simple word search game. It will allow users to either play a randomly generated word search digitally or print a hard copy to play on paper.

## Features
- Both printable/downloadable and digital versions of word search
	- Player can choose whether they would like to play immediately on their screen, or download the word search to print and play on paper.
- Themes
	- Player can choose from a number of themes for the words in their puzzle.
- Difficulty levels
	- Player can choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels for their puzzle.

## Challenges
- Creating or using a user interface for the digital game to be played in.
- Printing if player chooses paper version.
- Working with and manipulating lists that store the words and letters in the game.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A fully functioning word search puzzle game that allows players to choose either a digital or printed version of the game, then allows them to select the theme of the word search they would like to play.
